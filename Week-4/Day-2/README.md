# What is Week-4 Day-2
Hello hello, Welcome back in week 4. This is the second day of week 4. Coz in Week 3 and day 1 in week 4, we have exam and individual project. For individual project we create a class diagram of random games (board games) and I got the Othello game. You can see my Othello Class Diagram [here](https://github.com/ARidwanW/Bootcamp-SE-FMLX/blob/main/IndividualProject/ClassDiagram/class_diagram_othello.pdf).
