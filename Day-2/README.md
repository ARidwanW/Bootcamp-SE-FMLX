## In Detail
1. How compiler works in a Project Folder
   * the compiler will compile all .cs file if there's no `namespace` in the file
   * if u dont want to compile a .cs file, u can add `namespace` above all codes in that file
   * and if u want to compile it in `statci void Main()`, u need to add `using` in Main program

2. How to use variable in string (idk how to say lol, but like string interpolation)
   * u can use `$` before the string like
   * `string msg = $"Hello, My name is {name}"`
