### Conclusions
1. The purpose of this project is to create a library that any developers have flexibility to develop Marvel Snap Clone.
2. In the new class diagram there are several significant changes to the old class diagram, including:
    * Using AbstractCard & AbstractLocation rather than ICard & ILocation
    * Name convention
    * Additional variable & method
    * subtraction and addition of classes
3. From the results of the Marvel Snap Clone game development, the Library has been able to provide appropriate results and flexibility to users or developers, which is by having methods that carry game flow and plain methods that can be developed by users or developers themselves.
4. Through this project, I've come to realize that by innovating technology, new features emerge, leading to the sustainability of the technology itself.
